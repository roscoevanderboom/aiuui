# AIUUI (Artificial Intelligence Universal User Interface)

> 🚧 **Project Status: Early Development** - We're currently in the initial planning and foundation phase. Expect significant changes and improvements.

## Vision

AIUUI is an ambitious project to create a universal interface that seamlessly blends traditional user control with AI assistance. Our goal is to revolutionize how users interact with their computers by providing an intelligent, adaptive, and unified workspace.

## Core Features (Planned)

- 🚀 **Universal App Launcher**: Cross-platform application discovery and launching
- 🌐 **Intelligent Web Browser**: Seamlessly switch between manual and AI-assisted browsing
- 📁 **Smart File Management**: Advanced file operations with built-in code editing capabilities
- 🧩 **Widget Ecosystem**: Extensible widget system for custom tools and services
- 🔄 **Online/Offline Sync**: Continuous operation with or without internet connectivity
- 🤖 **AI Integration**: Deep AI assistance across all features

## Technology Stack

- **Desktop Framework**: [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) (Rust)
- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- **UI Components**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **Storage**: 
  - Local: IndexedDB/LocalStorage
  - Remote: MongoDB
- **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor
